**** Test Tooling ****
**********************
To write tests, I need a test framework.
A test framework gives a library that includes a bunch of utility functions to write tests.
Also gives a test runner which is a program that is ran from cli that executes the tests and gives a report of how many tests pass or fail.

There are several frameworks but at the time of this course creation one of the more popular ones was:
Jasmine, Mocha, Jest

Jasmine is one of the earlier ones.

Mocha is a fairly popular one, but by design it doesn't include certain features available with other libraries.
	To get those features you need to use plugins, the most popular are Chi and Sinon. If you use Jasmine you don't need the plugins.
	
Jest is a newer one and FB uses it for testing React applications. Its basicly a wrapper for Jasmine so if you know Jasmine, you know Jest.
	All the utility functions from Jasmine work with Jest but it also has a built in code coverage tool.

In Mosh's opinion, he prefers Jest as we get everything we need in a testing framework.
With Mocha you have to use 3rd party libraries and that means another place to go find docs. Also they evolve independent of each other which can cause problems.


Tools and frameworks come and go, focus on the fundamentals, not the tooling.
