**** How Node require() functions ****
**************************************

When require is called node will take 3 steps to determine what to load.

#1 it searches if the require is a Core module of Node.
If it is not, move one

#2 it checks if it is a file or folder in the project directory.
	require('underscore') means it will look for a folder named underscore with an index.js within it in the project directory. if the path begins with './' it will look for a file named underscore
failing that it moves to the next

#3 it checks if a folder named the same exists in the node_modules folder within the project directory.
