**** Continuously Running Tests ****
************************************

So far every time I make a change to the test or production code I have to go back to terminal and re-run npm test again.
This is tedious, especially with a large application, so this will cover how to have JEST continuously watch the files and eany time I make a change to either 
the test code or production code it will re-run the tests.

#1 - in package.json change the test command 
	"scripts": {
	  "test": "jest --watchAll"
	},

#2 - Back in terminal, when I run npm test, first JEST will run all of the test and then continue to watch for changes.
	When you save an edit, it will re-run the tests and output them to terminal.
	
	When working, you'd want to have the terminal visible somewhere so you can see those errors if they pop up.
