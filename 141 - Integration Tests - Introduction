**** Integration Testing ****
*****************************
Unit tests are quick to write and fast to execute. 
In real world apps we need to work with 1 or more resources, this is where integration tests come in.

In integration tests we test our code along with external resources as whole.

To write integration tests, we need a real database, populate it with data for testing, send an HTTP request to an endpoint to test, then make an assertion.
That assertion may involve inspecting the response or the Database.
For example, in testing a POST request to the database we may look at the DB and verify that the data is there.
