**** Deployment - Introduction ****
***********************************

2 options for deploying a node app.

#1 - Use a platform as a service provider (PAAS)
#2 - Use Docker

PAAS is good if you don't want to get involved with infrastructure. If you don't want to worry about servers, load balancer, restarting app on a crash.
There are a lot of options here: Heroku, Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Azure.

If you want more control over your deployment, if you want to deploy your node applications to your own webserver then Docker is a great option.
With Docker you can make an image of your app and deploy that image to any computer you want.

This section will cover deploying node apps to Heroku.
