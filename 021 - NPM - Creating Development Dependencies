**** Development Dependencies ****
**********************************
So far the dependencies outlined are for use in the project, but sometimes there are packages we want to used only during development. They should not go into the production environment.
Lets install a package called jshint into the dev environment.
	npm i jshint --save-dev
Now, I can see that jshint is under a different property, "devDependencies"
	All dependencies, regardless of type, are installed into node_modules folder, their only segregated in the package.json file.
