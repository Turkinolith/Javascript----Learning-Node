**** What is Test-Driven Development ****
*****************************************
When you get started with automated testing, a term heard often is Test-driven Development or TDD.

Also call test-first is an approach to building software.

With TDD you write tests BEFORE writing the production code.


How TDD Works:

#1 - Write a failing test.
#2 - Write the simplest code to make the test pass. Emphasis on simplest
#3 - Refactor if necessary.

Repeat these steps over and over till you have a complete feature.

Benefits of TDD:
#1 - Testable Source Code from the very start
#2 - Full code coverage by tests.
#3 - Simpler Implementation.


In contrast to Test first, there is Code First, which is what I've been doing.
TDD in theory is more promising, in practice it can get really complex and slow things down.
