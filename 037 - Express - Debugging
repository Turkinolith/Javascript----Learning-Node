**** Debugging ****
*******************
The debug package in node is a better way to debug than to use console.log all the time.
Can replace all of the console.logs used with a call to a debug function, then can use an environment-variable to enable/disable debugging
That way I don't have to keep coming back to the code and modifying it, can control it from the outside.
Also can control the level of the debug info I want to see.

In terminal:
npm i debug (npx it?)

in the module:
require('debug')
This require returns a function, we call the function and pass an argument. That argument is an arbitrary namespace that is used for debugging.
For example: I can define a namespace like 'app:startup', then when I call this function with this argument I get a function for writing debug messages in that namespace.
	const startupDebugger = require('debug')('app:startup');

I can call multiple namespace debuggers, lets say one for debugging databases:
	const startupDebugger = require('debug')('app:startup');
	const dbDebugger = require('debug')('app:db');

And to assign a debug line to a given namespace:
	startupDebugger('debug line triggered...');
or...
	dbDebugger('Connected to the database...');


Enabling debugging with Environment Variables:
Now back at the terminal:
	set DEBUG=app:startup
		This means that any debug info set to the 'app:startup' namespace will be enabled.

And of course to reset it:
	set DEBUG=
		This zeroes it out/removes it.

Or for multiple namespaces:
	set DEBUG=app:startup,app:db
		This will set both of those namespaces to DEBUG

Or if I want to enable every namespace I can use a wildcard:
	set DEBUG=app:*

There is also a faster way to set the level of debugging I want to see so I don't have to explicitly set the environment-variable.
Can set it at the time of running the app.
Lets say I only want to see app:db namespace:
	DEBUG=app:db nodemon index.js 
		or...
	DEBUG=app:db node index.js
		This sets the variable and then starts the app at the same time.
		
If I only am debugging a single thing in a given file I can simplify the syntax:
	const debug = require('debug')('app:startup');
	debug('something happened...');
