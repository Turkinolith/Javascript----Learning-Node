**** Logging Out a User ****
****************************
In the auth module I defined a route for authenticating users.
What about logging out users? Do I need a separate route?

No, because we're not storing the token anywhere on the server.

This would need to be implemented on the client, not the server, and they would simply delete the token from the client.
If you absolutely have to have the token in the DB, it should be hashed, just like the password.

Best to avoid storing the token on the server at all.

Also whenever sending the token from client to server, make sure to use HTTPS so that the data is encrypted between the 
client and the server.
