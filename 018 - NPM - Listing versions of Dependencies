*********************************
**** List installed Packages ****
*********************************
Chances are when you install a dependency that its version will be higher than the one specified in package.json.
So, how to find what the specific version installed is? There are 2 ways.
#1 Go into the package.json for the specific dependency and look at its version at the bottom of the file.
#2 To show all of the dependencies at once: 
	npm list
Within this tree you will see the dependencies with their version number, and in turn all of their sub dependencies with their version numbers.
If this list is too polluted and you don't care about the sub dependencies, use the flag --depth=0 to show only the main dependencies.
	npm list --depth=0
