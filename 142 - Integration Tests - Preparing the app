#1 -
	There was a mistake on line 5, 
	require("./startup/logging");
This function was required, but not called. So it wont work.
To fix this:
	require("./startup/logging")();

#2 -
	in package.json on the scripts section, test file: add the "--verbose" flag to it

  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --watchAll --verbose"
  },

This will give extra info in console and if something goes wrong can use that info to troubleshoot.

#3 -
	Logging module.
	For some reason the instructor says that in the logging.js module requiring winston-mogodb is causing tests to hang.
	So, for now hes commenting it out as well as the function that uses the mongoDB option.
	I'll do the same for parity.
