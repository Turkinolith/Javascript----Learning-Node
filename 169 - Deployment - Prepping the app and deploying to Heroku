***********************************************
**** Prepare the App & Deploying to Heroku ****
***********************************************

When a node app is deployed to Heroku it is initialized using npm start
However, I do not yet have a script defined for that in my package.json

add under scripts:
	"start": "node index.js"

I also need to add another property to package.json
	"engines": {
	
	}

Here I define the version of Node that I'm using.
using node -v I get the version I'm using and then I add it into the value.

  "engines": {
    "node": "12.14.1"
  },



	**** DEPLOYING ****
	*******************
To deploy to heroku from the command line, navigate to the app folder
	heroku create <optional app name, must be unique so can leave empty otherwise to get assigned one>


In this case my app deployed with name: salty-tundra-51627
The address of the app on Heroku is given, also it gives the address of the remote git repository.

if I run: git remote -v 
I get the list of remote repositories.

Now, to deply I do:
	git push heroku master

This means push changes from local repository to a different one, in this case heroku.
Master is the name of the branch that we're currently working on.


	*** VERIFICATION ***
	********************
After pushing to Heroku I get build succeded and it gives me an address.
https://salty-tundra-51627.herokuapp.com/

So, I paste this into postman and send a git request to the genres.
https://salty-tundra-51627.herokuapp.com/api/genres

I get an error, 503 - Service Unavailable, so lets learn how to look at logs to diagnose this.
