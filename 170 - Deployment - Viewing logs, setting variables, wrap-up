**** Viewing Logs ****
**********************
To diagnose why the app isn't working I can look at Heroku logs in terminal or on the dashboard.

In terminal
	heroku logs
	
in dashboard:
	Click "more" in top right and select view logs.
	
	*** NOTE: ***
	*************
These logs are not the ones I added to my app.
To view those I need to either use SSH protocol to connect directly to the Heroku server

Or

in dashboard, click "more" click "run console", run "bash"
that connects to the dyno or server, then it gives a terminal.
run "ls" and it gives a list of files, then can view it using "cat filename"
	"cat exceptions.log"


To add environment variables:

	heroku config:set <variablename=variablekey>

IE:
	heroku config:set vidly_jwtPrivateKey=value

	*** ESCAPING SPECIAL CHARACTERS ***
	***********************************
If I need to escape special characters due to it being parsed wrong, like ! & ? etc.
Put double quotes around it!
	452"@"tester-vidly"?"retryWrites=true"^&"w=majority
in this case the @, the ?, and the ^& are escaped


After setting these up I have 3 keys now:
NODE_ENV: production
vidly_jwtPrivateKey
vidly_mongoDBKey



	*** NOTE ON CLOUD ARCHITECTURE ON HEROKU ***
	********************************************
By default you have one server, which is called a dyno.
If you want to scale the app, you add more dynos.
They have a temp file system. Every time they are restarted the file system is wiped out.
This is why you can't store anything on their file system.
If you want storage there are different kinds of add-ons for storing different kinds of data.
The only thing they share, are the Environment variables.
You set the variables at the app level and Heroku will auto replicate them across all dynos.

**** MongoDB in the Cloud - Setting MongoDB to work with Heroku ****
********************************************************************

On the project dashboard click on "Resources", then "find more add-ons"
Filter the Heroku add-ons by "Data Stores" and go select "mLab MongoDB"

mongodb+srv://vidlyuser:5UfO6cjKJRmfv675@

**** DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY! 
LESSONS FROM THIS:
I initially had the program crash repeatedly in deployment.
What happened? Kept getting the error: "MODULE_NOT_FOUND"
After digging around I found that the require paths for multiple files had the path "../models/xxx" instead of "../Models/xxx", CAPITALIZATION MATTERS!
