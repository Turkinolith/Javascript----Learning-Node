Before creating a Node project, you should create a package.json file.
This file has information about your project, such as the name, version, authors, address of git repository, dependencies, etc. It's meta-data 
All node apps by standard have a package.json file.

To create one run:
npm init

It will walk you step-by-step through creating the file.

There is a faster way to do this if you just want the default answers:
npm init --yes
