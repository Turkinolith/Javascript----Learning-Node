**** Viewing Registry info for a package ****
*********************************************
to look at the info on a package from the command line (without having installed it first)
	npm view packagename
This has all of the meta-data like dependencies, version, etc.
If this is too cluttered you can filter this down, like to show only the dependencies.
	npm view packagename dependencies
or view all released versions of the package:  *This is useful if you want to downgrade or upgrade to a specific version.
	npm view packagename versions
