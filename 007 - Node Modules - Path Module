Path module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. it can be accessed using:
const path = require('path');

The argument to require, node assumes it is a built-in module, if there is no built-in module by the name specified then it looks for the existence of a 
relative path to a file in the app. IE: if there is './path' or '../path' it assumes its a file within the app folder.

** Parse Method **
path.parse(__filename) <-- __filename is one of the arguments in the module wrapper function from last lesson.
Now I'll save this in a vairable called pathObj then log it to console

This returns: *Note: if I use my extension to run it via F8, the base and name are differently named because its ran from a temp file.
{
  root: 'D:\\',
  dir: 'D:\\Node_tutorial\\first-app',
  base: 'app.js',
  ext: '.js',
  name: 'app'
}

This has a few useful properties:
root = The path to the root of the drive the file is on.
dir = The path to the directory where the file is located within.
base = name of the file with extension.
ext = the extension only of the file.
name = the name of the file minus extension.

So, working with paths is way easier with the path module than working with strings.
