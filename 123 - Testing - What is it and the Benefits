**** What is Automated Testing ****
***********************************

Its the practice of writing code to test the code and run the test in an automated fashion.
it consists of production code and test code.

With automated testing you write code and directly call the code with different inputs to verify it returns the right output.
Automated Tests are repeatable.


Benefits of Automated Testing -
You can test code frequently, in less time.
catch bugs before deploying.
Refactor code with confidence.
	Refactoring means changing structure without changing behavior.
When you don't have automated tests you have to re-test manually all of the code that may be affected.
Helps you focus more on the quality
