**** Working with Global Packages ****
**************************************

When installing a package from NPM by default it is local, specific to the project folder that it is installed within.
But there are some packages, command line tools and others, that you want to be global in scope and accessible from anywhere.
npm itself is an example of this.

to install a package globally use the -g flag.

To check if a global package is outdated:
npm -g outdated

similarly to update:
npm -g update
