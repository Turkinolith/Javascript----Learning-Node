**** Nodemon ****
*****************
This is an app that auto restarts node scripts on save.
npm i -g nodemon

To use, instead of starting apps with node, use nodemon instead.
IE: nodemon index.js, nodemon app.js
It will then watch for changes to any files within the folder it is started within. As soon as a file is saved with changes it will auto restart.
Naturally it helps to start this up from a file in the top layer of the app file structure.
