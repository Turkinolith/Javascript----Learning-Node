******************************
**** Express Async Errors ****
******************************
This uses the package: "express-async-errors"

To use this in index.js require the package, don't need to store it as a constant.
	require("express-async-errors");

in genres.js I can remove the call to asyncMiddleware I created on the .get route.
finally, I'll remove the require to the middleware I set up.

Tested in postman and the connection worked.
Then I pulled the internet plug and tried again.
After a long time postman finally timed out, I had error 500 and the message "Something Failed" as I wrote in the error middleware.

This is a very easy way to handle async errors.
If this app doesn't work for whatever reason, then I need to swap back to the async middleware function.
