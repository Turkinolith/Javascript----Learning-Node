**********************
**** Test Pyramid ****
**********************

This methodology argues that unit tests should be the foundation of testing with the largest numbers and types since their easy and quick to write,
	with several integration tests next, and finally and in the smallest amount, end to end tests for key functions. E2E shouldn't test edge cases, only test happy path and
	test edge cases with unit tests.
	
The actual ration between the 3 tests depends on your project.

Takeaways:
	favor unit tests to e2e tests, their quicker to write and faster to perform.
	Cover unit test gaps with integration tests.
	use end-to-end tests sparingly.
