**** Environment Variables ****
*******************************
One thing that needs to be fixed in the webserver is the hard-coded value for the port #.
While this may work on the development machine it is unlikely to work in a production environment because when this is deployed to a hosting environment the port is dynamically assigned by the hosting environment.
To fix this I need to use an environment variable.

Typically in hosting environments for node apps there is an environment variable called PORT.

An environment variable is basically a variable that is part of the environment in which a process runs.
Example in react would be .env.production: REACT_APP_API_URL=###### vs .env.development: REACT_APP_API_URL=&&&&&&& which in turn were set in file using process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL

process is a global object it has a property called env which is short for environment variable, then you add the name of the variable.

	const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
	app.listen(port, () => console.log(`listening on port ${port}...`));
	
So, if the environment variable PORT exists, set it to the constant port, else, use 3000

Now, to set an environment variable.

To do this on the command line:
In Windows: set PORT=5000
In Mac: export PORT=5000


Can also do this in environment files, but node doesn't auto use them on its own. 
You have to set it up either as a configuration in VS Code, using a module, or in another way.
