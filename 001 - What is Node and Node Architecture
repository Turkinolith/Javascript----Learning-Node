********************************************
**** What is Node and Node Architecture ****
********************************************

Open source cross platform runtime environment for executing JS outside of a browser.

Node is easy to start and great for prototyping.
Also good for highly scalable services.
Cleaner and more consistent codebase
Large ecosystem of open source libs.

Node is a C++ program with googles V8 engine embedded into it along with other modifications to provide a runtime environment for JS code outside of the browser.
Also has certain objects to provide an environment different from browsers.
there is no document objects
you CAN work with the file system and listen for requests on a given port, etc.

You can't compare node to Ruby, C#, etc. because they are completely different things, its not a programming language.
Similarly you can't compare node with ASP.NET, Rails, Django, etc because those are frameworks. Node is not a framework, its a runtime environment.
